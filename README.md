# pma-voice
A voice system designed around the use of FiveM/RedM internal mumble server.

## Support

Please report any issues you have in the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice/issues)

### NOTE: It is expected for servers to be on the latest recommended version, which you can find [here for Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and [here for Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/).

# Compatibility Notice:

This script is not compatible with other voice systems (duh), that means if you have vMenus voice chat you will **have** to [disable](https://docs.vespura.com/vmenu/faq/#q-how-do-i-disable-voice-chat) it.

Please do not override `NetworkSetTalkerProximity`, `MumbleSetAudioInputDistance`, `MumbleSetAudioOutputDistance` or `NetworkSetVoiceActive` in any of your other scripts as there have been cases where it breaks pma-voice.

# FiveM/RedM Config

### NOTE: Only use one of the Audio options (don't enable 3d Audio & Native Audio at the same time), its also recommended to always use voice_useSendingRangeOnly.

You only need to add the convar **if** you're changing the value.

All of the configs here are set using `setr [voice_configOption] [boolean]`

Native audio will not work on RedM, you will have to use 3d audio.

| ConVar                     | Default | Description                                                   | Parameter(s) |
|----------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| voice_useNativeAudio       |  false  | **This will not work for RedM** Uses the games native audio, will add 3d sound, echo, reverb, and more. **Required for submixs**   | boolean      |
| voice_use2dAudio           |  false  | Uses 2d audio, will result in same volume sound no matter where they're at until they leave proximity. | boolean      
| voice_use3dAudio           |  false  | Uses 3d audio | boolean |
| voice_useSendingRangeOnly  |  false  | Only allows you to hear people within your hear/send range, prevents people from connecting to your mumble server and trolling. | boolean      |

# Config

### PLEASE NOTE: Any keybind changes only affect new players, if you want to change your key bind go to Key Bindings -> FiveM -> Look for keybinds under 'pma-voice'.

All of the config is done via ConVars in order to streamline the process.

The ints are used like a boolean to 0 would be false, 1 true.

All of the configs here are set using `setr [voice_configOption] [int]` OR `setr [voice_configOption] "[string]"`

#### Note: If a convar defaults to 1 (true) you don't have set it again unless you want to disable it.

### Aces

pma-voice comes with a built in /muteply (tgtPly) (duration) command, in order to allow your staff to use it you will have to grand them the ace!

Example:
`add_ace group.superadmin command.muteply allow;`

This would only allow the superadmin group to mute players.
