### Disclaimer: Code in the main repo is considered to be 'dev', please use the [Latest Release](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice/releases) for a stable version.

# pma-voice
A voice system designed around the use if FiveM's internal mumble server.

## Support

Please report any issues you have in the GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/AvarianKnight/pma-voice/issues)

### NOTE: It is expected for servers to be on the latest recommended version, which you can find [here for Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and [here for Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/).

# Compatibility Notice:

This script is not compatible with other voice systems (duh), that means if you have vMenus voice chat you will **have** to [disable](https://docs.vespura.com/vmenu/faq/#q-how-do-i-disable-voice-chat) it.

Please do not override `NetworkSetTalkerProximity`, `MumbleSetAudioInputDistance`, `MumbleSetAudioOutputDistance` or `NetworkSetVoiceActive` in any of your other scripts as there have been cases where it breaks pma-voice.

# FiveM Config

### NOTE: Only use one of the Audio options (don't enable 3d Audio & Native Audio at the same time), its also recommended to always use voice_useSendingRangeOnly.

You only need to add the convar **if** you're changing the value.

All of the configs here are set using `setr [voice_configOption] [boolean]`

| ConVar                     | Default | Description                                                   | Parameter(s) |
|----------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| voice_useNativeAudio       |  false  | Uses the games native audio, will add 3d sound, echo, reverb, and more. Required for submixs   | boolean      |
| voice_use3dAudio           |  false  | DEPRECATED: Use `voice_useNativeAudio` instead. Uses 3d audio, will base voices dependent where the player(s) are. | boolean      |
| voice_use2dAudio           |  false  | Uses 2d audio, will result in same volume sound no matter where they're at until they leave proximity. | boolean      |
| voice_useSendingRangeOnly  |  false  | Only allows you to hear people within your hear/send range, prevents people from connecting to your mumble server and trolling. | boolean      |


# Config

All of the config is done via ConVars in order to streamline the process.

The ints are used like a boolean to 0 would be false, 1 true.

### Aces
pma-voice comes with a built in /mute command, in order to allow your staff to use it you will have to grand them the ace!

Example:
`add_ace group.superadmin command.mute allow;`

This would only allow the superadmin group to mute players.
